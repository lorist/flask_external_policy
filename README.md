# Pexip External Policy Server with Web UI

This project is a powerful, web-based external policy server for Pexip Infinity, built with Flask. It allows administrators to create and manage dynamic, rule-based policies for call control through an intuitive dashboard interface, removing the need to write custom code for each policy change.

## Features

* **Web Dashboard:** A clean, modern dashboard to create, view, edit, and delete policy rules.
* **Dual Policy Support:** Handles both **Service Configuration** and **Participant Properties** policy requests.
* **Dynamic Rule Engine:**
    * Create rules with multiple conditions.
    * Use a variety of operators, including `equals`, `contains`, `does not contain`, and custom `regex`.
    * Set rule **priority** to control the evaluation order.
* **Rule Management:**
    * **Enable/Disable** rules with a simple toggle switch without deleting them.
    * Grouped view to easily distinguish between service and participant rules.
* **Dynamic Overrides:** For `continue` actions, you can dynamically override Pexip's default settings on a per-call basis for both service and participant properties.
* **In-App Policy Tester:** A UI panel to simulate participant policy requests and preview the server's JSON response without making a live call.
* **Database Migrations:** Uses Flask-Migrate (Alembic) to safely manage database schema changes without losing data.
* **CLI Commands:** Includes commands for easy database setup, seeding with default rules, and complete resets for development.

## Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* `pip` for package installation

## Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get the application running locally.

### 1. Set Up the Environment

First, clone the repository and create a Python virtual environment.

```bash
# Clone the repository (if you haven't already)
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-folder>

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages.

```bash
pip install Flask Flask-SQLAlchemy Flask-Migrate
```

*(**Note:** For easy deployment, you can save your dependencies to a file: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`)*

### 3. Set Up the Database

This application uses Flask-Migrate to manage the database.

```bash
# Set the FLASK_APP environment variable
export FLASK_APP=app.py  # On Windows, use: set FLASK_APP=app.py

# 1. Initialize the migration environment (only run this once per project)
flask db init

# 2. Generate the initial migration script from your models
flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"

# 3. Apply the migration to create the database file
flask db upgrade
```

### 4. (Optional) Seed the Database

You can populate the database with a few default example rules to get started.

```bash
flask seed-db
```

## Usage

### 1. Running the Server

Start the Flask development server. The `--host=0.0.0.0` flag is crucial to make the server accessible to other machines on your network, like your Pexip Conferencing Nodes.

```bash
flask run --debug --host=0.0.0.0
```

The server will be running on port `5000`.

### 2. Accessing the Admin Dashboard

Open your web browser and navigate to the admin interface:

`http://<your_server_ip>:5000/admin`

Here, you can manage all your policy rules.

### 3. Configuring Pexip Infinity

In your Pexip Infinity Administrator interface, you need to point your policy profiles to this server's endpoints:

* **Participant Properties URL:** `http://<your_server_ip>:5000`

---

## Testing Policies

The dashboard includes a **Policy Tester** panel that allows you to simulate a participant policy request and see a live preview of the server's response.

1.  Navigate to the admin dashboard.
2.  In the **Policy Tester** panel, click the **"ï¼‹ Add Parameter"** button to add one or more request parameters you want to simulate (e.g., `remote_alias`, `idp_attribute_rank`).
3.  Fill in the values for your test parameters.
4.  Click the **"Test Policy"** button.
5.  The **Server Response Preview** box will update to show the exact JSON response the server would send to Pexip for that request.

This allows you to verify your rules and their priorities without needing to make a live call.

## Database Management Commands

* **Reset the Database:** To completely wipe and re-seed the database during development, use the custom `reset-db` command.

    ```bash
    flask reset-db
    ```

* **Making Schema Changes:** If you modify the models in `app.py` (e.g., add a new column), follow this two-step process to safely update the database:

    ```bash
    # 1. Generate a new migration script
    flask db migrate -m "A short message about your changes"

    # 2. Apply the changes to the database
    flask db upgrade
